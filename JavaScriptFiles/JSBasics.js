 Variable naming convention:
 
 * Variable names are case sensitive: "a" is different from "A"
 * Only letters, digits, underscore(_) and $ are allowed.
 * Onlu a letter, underscore or $ should be 1st character of variable.
 eg: name, _val, $value, name1 (valid names for variable)
     12value, my name (invalid)
 * Reserved words cannot be variable names.
